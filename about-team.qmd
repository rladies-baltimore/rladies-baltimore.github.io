[**Stephanie Hicks**](https://www.stephaniehicks.com) | Hello! I work at the intersection of data science and health as an Associate Professor of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. In 2018, I co-founded R-Ladies Baltimore with [Alexis Norris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisleighnorris) and today I help co-organize R-Ladies Baltimore events!

[**Margaret Taub**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/2744/margaret-taub) | I am an Associate Scientist in the Johns Hopkins Department of Biostatistics where I collaborate with scientists working to understand the genetics and genomics of chronic pain, cardiovascular disease and asthma, among other things. I also teach a large undergraduate biostatistics course, mainly to students studying public health, and a couple of smaller courses on R programming and data analysis. I have been a co-organizer of R-Ladies Baltimore since 2018 and love meeting people from all over the world who share an interest in R!

[**Rachael Workman**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachael-workman-a24a2a1a3/) | I am a PhD candidate, soon to be Postdoc, at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine studying how bacteria protect themselves from viruses. I largely learned R on the job through working in a genomics lab and hacking together scripts best I could, and have loved being a co-organizer of R-ladies since 2018 fortifying my coding experience and meeting such accomplished scientists and programmers.

[**Afrooz Razi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/afroozrazi) | Hi! I am a PhD candidate at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. My background is in biology and working in a wet lab. I remember how scary it was to begin learning R programming and to make that big change in my career path. I joined the R-Ladies Baltimore as a co-organizer in 2021 to encourage others who like me are now ready to make a change and learn more about R
