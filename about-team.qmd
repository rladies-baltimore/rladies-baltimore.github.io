[**Margaret Taub**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/2744/margaret-taub) | I am an Associate Scientist in the Johns Hopkins Department of Biostatistics where I collaborate with scientists working to understand the genetics and genomics of chronic pain, cardiovascular disease and asthma, among other things. I also teach a large undergraduate biostatistics course, mainly to students studying public health, and a couple of smaller courses on R programming and data analysis. I have been a co-organizer of R-Ladies Baltimore since 2018 and love meeting people from all over the world who share an interest in R!
