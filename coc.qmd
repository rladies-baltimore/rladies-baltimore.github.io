The leadership, mentoring & teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority genders (majority gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team's discretion). Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development & support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deems appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Baltimore is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team.

Full community guidelines are found here: [rladies/starter-kit/wiki](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki).
