# R-Ladies Baltimore 


Welcome! R-Ladies Baltimore welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you are a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our non-profit, civil society community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!

## Who are we 

A local chapter of [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org), R-Ladies Baltimore exists to promote gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world.

We are part of [Global R-Ladies](https://rladies.org) group. Here are some links! You can access our presentations, R scripts and more on our Github account and follow us on twitter to stay up to date about R-Ladies news!
